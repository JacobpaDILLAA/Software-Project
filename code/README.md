<h1 align="center">Welcome to F.R.I.C</h1>

> The Cyber Experimentation & Analysis Division (CEAD) recognizes the complexity and the time it takes to
manage task assignments, progress, vulnerability discovery during a cyber engagement and generate custom
reports that presents the discovered vulnerabilities and potential issues to CEAD‚Äôs target audience. They want a
system that would aid the management of task, collection of evidence, and report generation during a cyber
engagement.
The University of Texas at El Paso (UTEP) and CEAD are collaborating to develop Findings and Reporting
Information Console (FRIC) system that will provide the ability to manage task assignment and progress, and
facilitate the collection of evidence on existing vulnerabilities, and generation of custom reports.
